Polynomiography is a a visual art form that involves visualization of complex polynomials.

...

In this work we will explore new methods to generate  artistic images/image sequences from polynomials. We will create a Python library to help people use and improve these methods for generating artistic images from polynomials. Our goal is to encourage more research and experimentation in this area by sharing these methods as open-source software.
